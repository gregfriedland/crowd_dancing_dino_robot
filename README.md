Dinosaurs & Lasers
========================

What if dinosaurs could dance? And what if you could control them to dance with you?

These and related questions were our muses for Science Hack Day 2014 in San Francisco. We laser cut some dinos and 
attached servo motors to various joints so they could move.
The servos were connected through an Arduino to a node.js program which served a simple website to aggregate
phone accelerometer data. So you could browse to the website with your phone, put it in your pocket and start dancing, 
then the dinosaurs would dance with you!

Here is the Arduino code for controlling the servos and node.js code for aggregating the accelerometer data.
